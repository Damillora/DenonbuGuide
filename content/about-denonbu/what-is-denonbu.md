## What actually is Denonbu?

From the beginning, Denonbu as a series often defies explanation on what it actually is, thanks to the wealth of activities that Denonbu does. Today, the most general way to describe Denonbu would be **a group of creators that makes content in a shared setting**. Casts, composers, illustrators, and other creators come to Denonbu and make all sorts of things under the Denonbu banner.

## Why Denonbu?

Denonbu is the sort of franchise that wants to build a community and culture around various aspects of technology and pop culture.
For example, Denonbu is one of the first multimedia project that employs VTubers as *a core part of the cast*. It incorporates various aspects of Japanese pop culture, from idols, seiyuus, VTubers, music producers, illustrators, to *science-fiction*! Because of that, Denonbu is **a gateway to the wider world**, an intersection of various pop cultures.

## Core Content

Denonbu is a series that relies *very heavily* on music. To that point, Denonbu appointed an eclectic mix of composers from various walks of life, from anisong composers to actual club music producers. Denonbu music is usually published worldwide on streaming and download platforms, so music is the most easily accessible aspect of Denonbu. From this core music content, other content of Denonbu follows.

Denonbu's other main strength is events. Aside from its own events, Denonbu also frequently participates as guests for other events as well, both singing and DJ performances.
