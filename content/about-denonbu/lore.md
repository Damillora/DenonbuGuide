title: Denonbu Lore
workInProgress: true

Despite being a series about high school students DJing, Denonbu has a surprisingly deep foundation for its lore!

## An AI post-singularity outlook

Denonbu is set in the year 2062. In the Denonbu timeline, the development of artificial intelligence has reached a turning point: a technology singularity, where technology development has become uncontrollable and irreversible. Because of this technological advancement, menial work has been subsumed into Artificial Intelligence. However, AI in this timeline did not rebel against its creators (at least, not yet, for complex reasons), and so, humanity became free to pursue creative work, like music creation. Thanks to advancements in network and digital space technology, humanity is no longer constrained by space, and is able to basically live anywhere, so they instead grouped by culture, people with similar interests and tastes go to the same place.

In this setting, the Denonbu story unfolds. Electronic music becomes the heart of the world's music culture, and in this era, DJs are the new celebrities and superstars. Those DJs compete and perform through a system called STACK BATTLE. This culture even pervades high-schoolers, and they form extracurricular clubs called the "electronic music club". The denonbu, if you will.

Those STACK BATTLEs are a spectacle to behold, involving high-technology special effects, thanks to a device that handles everything in a DJ battle show, from the visual effects, the PA system, even the lighting: the AI Hologram Speaker "FAIHS". The name of FAIHS' inventor, however, might ring a bell to people familiar with Namco games: NEUCOM Entertainment.

## A note about the UGSF series

This is a guide about Denonbu, not the UGSF, so I'll be brief. By virtue of its inclusion of NEUCOM and GR, Denonbu is part of the shared universe that is the United Galaxy Space Force series. This shared universe connects many, many Namco and Bandai Namco games together. It connects the futuristic setting of Denonbu to the legacy of Namco's past.

The UGSF series has [its own website](https://ugsf-series.com/en/), although it has not been updated since 2014.
