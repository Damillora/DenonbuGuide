---

Denonbu currents contains 15 characters from 5 units. In the future, five more areas will be added.

## Akiba: Sotokanda Literature High School

Under Japan's new ward division plan, the areas formerly known as Akihabara and Kanda has fused into Akiba, and while it has still its signature electronic shops and anime shops, the place also has become a place to study and develop Japan's system infrastructure. In this area, there's Sotokanda Literature High School, whose curicculum is tailored to the Akiba area, and all the Akiba characters studies in this school.

### Hidaka Reina

Reina is the center of the Sotokanda Literature High School's denonbu. She likes everything mecha, from watching the shows to making plastic models. While she isn't exactly the brightest (she is clumsy), but she's gentle and honest, and when focusing on one thing, Reina can give her all into it.

### Shinonome Kazune

Kazune is the student council president of Sotokanda Literature High School and the president of the school's denonbu. Her family runs a game center (which is named Fardraut, in a homage to Xevious, no less), so understandably, she's an avid gamer. As expected from the denonbu president, she is also capable as a DJ! She also really, *really* like cute girls, to the point that she *invented* the term Yurionbu.

### Kayano Futaba

Futaba is the rookie of the Sotokanda Literature High School denonbu. Her parents own an idol theater, and she has DJing and dancing to idol songs as her secret hobby. Give her a microphone, and she will unleash her inner idol soul.

## Harajuku: Jingumae Sando High School

Under Japan's new ward division plan, the areas formerly known as Harajuku and Omotesando has now fused into the Harajuku area. Because of the rapid growth of the Shibuya area, in turn thanks to the massive proliferation of global DJ culture, Harajuku (a district of Shibuya in real-life) becomes its own area, and has its own identity, thanks to the combination of "kawaii" fashion and traditional Japanese fashion.

In this area, there's Jingumae Sando High School, which is a branch school of the famed Teion International High School from Shibuya. All the Harajuku area characters study in this school.

### Sakurano Mimito

This particular girl failed to enter the most prestigious high school over at Shibuya, and has to settle with Jingumae Sando, the branch school. As a result, Mimito joined the school's denonbu with the explicit aim of defeating Teion.

Publicly, she regards herself as the cutest, the greatest, and the best DJ in the world. She looks like she doesn't put much effort into stuff, but she is a hard-worker in reality! It's just that... she suffered from the same problems faced by some childhood prodigies.

Be aware: she is probably *the* character who got affected the most in Season 2 of Denonbu.

### Minakami Hina

Hina is a world-famous illustrator, and the mascot she drew are everywhere (in the Denonbu world, at least). She's capable of DJing, since she did it in the past, but she joins the school's denonbu at the insistence of none other than Mimito. She often becomes the subject of pity from other members of her denonbu, but she does her best!

### Inubousaki Shian

From a family of shrine maidens, and even being set up as her shrine's next priest, Shian turns to DJing as a form of escapism from the many societal obligations that her family has, and the reason she joined the Harajuku denonbu in the first place. She doesn't speak that often, and instead mainly posts her thoughts on a private social media account.

## Azabu: Minato Shirokane Girls' High School

Under Japan's new ward division plan, the areas formerly known as Minato and Shinagawa has now fused into the Azabu area. The majority of land in this area is own by the Shirokane Zaibatsu, and yes, they also own the school in the area, Minato Shirokane Girls' High School. I mean, the name has Shirokane in it, and all the characters in the Azabu area study there. The pace of modernization has the Zaibatsu worried, however, and pursued further development of the area.

### Kurogane Tama

Tama is a maid of the Shirokane family, and a personal maid of Shirokane Aki. Her task as a maid is a bit interesting: to be friends with Aki. She is quite the haughty person, and likes using the influence of the Shirokane family as a shield, even though she's a maid. Her family also owns a bar in Roppongi, called BABEL.

### Shirokane Aki

From the surname, you can guess that she is part of the family that owns the Shirokane Zaibatsu. She is the president of the Azabu denonbu, and also the daughter of the school's principal. She is surprisingly shy, but she doesn't show it often because she represents the school in some capacity. While she often used her financial influence to solve her problems, she longs for connections with people that aren't just because of the money. There is a reason Tama's task is that specific.

### Haijima Ginka

Ginka is a member of the Haijima family, one of the Shirokane family's notable rivals. However, she's part of the Azabu denonbu, because Aki invited her. She is reserved but sociable, making her look cool and garnering many fans in the school.

One extremely interesting quirk of Ginka, is her eating habits. She's extremely punctual when it comes to eating. She has her own meal schedule, and will literally leave everything else when the time comes. Even when she's on a DJ table.

The reason why Aki invited Ginka to join the Azabu denonbu... is because it is possibly the only connection Aki has with Ginka, with whom she *fell in love*!

## Shibuya: Teion International High School

Under Japan's new ward division plan, the area around Shibuya Station is now the Shibuya area. This area is the center of Japan's electronic music scene, a fashion hub, and very popular with young people. With AI speakers floating around the area, the entirety of Shibuya feels like a club.

In this area, there's Teion International High School. This school is very well-known, and some of their students are well-known for their activities even though they're still on high-school! Truly a top-class school. All Shibuya area characters study in this school.

### Houou Karin

Karin is a very popular person, for sure. She has appeared multiple times in media, and has a very charismatic personality and outstanding DJ skills... on stage. Outside of the stage, she can be very lazy, to the point one of her socks is longer than the other... which other people intrepreted as fashion!

### Seto Mitsuki

Mitsuki is trained in the ways of the piano, and she is descended from a line of musicians. She excels at logic and calculation, and uses them often while DJing. Her aim is perfection, and so she is often unsatisfied with her current state. This, however, also means that Mitsuki often has to tend to the other Shibuya denonbu members, so much so that she is sometimes referred to as their *mother*.

Karin was the one who brought Mitsuki to the Shibuya denonbu and taught her to DJ.

### Taiga Lucia

This girl hailing from another country can be described with a phrase: "neuron activation", and when she wants to do something, she will just do it on instinct, without any thought put into it. She also really, really likes fighting other people through DJ battles, and because of this, Karin and Mitsuki just don't know how to deal with her. However, she is also surprisingly friendly (if she doesn't randomly try to duel, that is).

## Kabuki: Shin-Shinjuku GR School

Under Japan's new ward division plan, the areas formerly known as Shinjuku and Shin-Okubo has fused into the Kabuki area. Prior to the Singularity, Kabuki was well-known as an entertainment district (well, yeah) and very popular with foreign tourists, before some of it was reformed to promote Japanese culture more. However, other parts of Kabuki are still rampant with crime, making the area pretty unsafe.

This area has the Shin-Shinjuku GR School. Yes, that GR (read the [Denonbu lore](/about-denonbu/lore) page to find out more!). There aren't many club activities in this school since it isn't an accredited school, and because official STACK BATTLEs utilizes NEUCOM's technology, Shin-Shinjuku GR School is not able to participate in those battles either.

### Ogami Matoi

Matoi is an underground DJ (the literal translation is "illegal DJ", which made waves for a while) that operates in the Kabuki area. She really doesn't like the Singularity and the effects it had upon the world (it's spearheaded by NEUCOM!), and she wants utilize the power of GR to "become God" and destroy everything.

### Abeno-Shakuji-Maya

Maya was born in a temple in the Asakusa area, and raised in a Shinto shrine in the Kabuki area. Despite being in a religious environment, because she was thrown away as a child, Maya has come to despise the gods that did not come to her aid. That is, until she met Matoi. After that, she became an ardent follower of Matoi, seeking to make her the only God.

### Reml

Reml... is Reml. She's actually batshit insane. She earnestly wishes for peoples' misery. She actually wants to see people suffer, and she loves being hated by others. She also brings along a creature called Pomemori, and she likes inflicting violence on it. Just plain batshit insane.

Also, Reml is one Reml. She is a clone part of "Distributed Autonomous Golem Reml" line of mass-produced clones, based on a person also called Reml. This line of clones has a MusicCrystal as its heart, and can resonate and change in a thousand different ways based on music.
